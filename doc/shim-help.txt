===============================================================================
 INFO
===============================================================================
This is an application 'shim' that will execute another application (typically
named the same located elsewhere). Execute with --shim-NoOp to identify its
target.

Execute SHIM_EXEC -h or visit https://github.com/jphilbert/shim_executable for
additional information.


===============================================================================
 ARGUMENTS
===============================================================================
The arguments below can be passed to the shim prior to it executing its parent.
They are not case-sensitive and have an equivilent shimgen alias for
Chocolately compatibility.

Technically the arguments need only match "--shim[a-z]*-[hlwegun][a-z]*".

All other argument are passed to the parent executable.

    --shim-Help     Shows this help menu and exits without running the target

    --shim-Log      Turns on diagnostic messaging in the console. If a windows
                        application executed without a console, a file (<shim
                        path>.SHIM.LOG) will be generated instead.
                        (alias --shimgen-log)

    --shim-Wait     Explicitly tell the shim to wait for target to exit. Useful
                        when something is calling a GUI and wanting to block
                        command line programs. This is the default behavior
                        unless the shim was created with the --GUI flag. Cannot
                        be used with --shim-Exit or --shim-GUI.
                        (alias --shimgen-waitforexit)

    --shim-Exit     Explicitly tell the shim to exit immediately after creating
                        the application process. This is the default behavior
                        when the shim was created with the --GUI flag. Cannot
                        be used with --shim-Wait.
                        (alias --shimgen-exit)

    --shim-GUI      Explicitly behave as if the target is a GUI application.
                        This is helpful in situations where the package did not
                        have a proper .gui file. This technically has the same
                        effect as --shim-Exit and is kept for legacy purposes.
                        (alias --shimgen-gui)

    --shim-UseTargetWorkingDirectory
                    Set the working directory to the target path if omitted. By
                        default the application will use the shim's path.
                        Useful when programs need to be running from where they
                        are located (usually indicates programs that have
                        issues being run globally).
                        (alias --shimgen-UseTargetWorkingDirectory)

    --shim-NoOp     Executes the shim without calling the target application.
                        Logging is implicitly turned on.
                        (alias --shimgen-noop)
