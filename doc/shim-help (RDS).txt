Shim Help
=========

This is a shim, generated by Chocolatey's ShimGenerator (shimgen).
This shim calls a target with the following settings:
 Target: 'C:\xxxxx\xxxxx\xxxxx\console_app.exe'
 Target exists: 'True'
 Working directory: 'C:\xxxxx\xxxxx\xxxxx\'
 GUI: 'False'
 Wait for exit: 'True'
 command (optional): 'this is a saved argument'

Shim Arguments
==============

You can pass the following arguments to a shim:

 * shimgen-help - shows this help menu and exits without running the
   target
 * shimgen-log - logging is shown on command line
 * shimgen-waitforexit - explicitly tell the shim to wait for target to
   exit - useful when something is calling a gui and wanting to block
   - command line programs explicitly have waitforexit already set
 * shimgen-exit - explicitly tell the shim to exit immediately.
 * shimgen-gui - explicitly behave as if the target is a GUI
   application. This is helpful in situations where the package did not
   have a proper .gui file.
 * shimgen-usetargetworkingdirectory - set the working directory to the
   target path. Useful when programs need to be running from where they
   are located (usually indicates programs that have issues being run
   globally)
 * shimgen-noop - Do not actually call the target. Useful to see what
   would happen if you ran the command.
