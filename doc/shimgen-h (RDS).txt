ShimGen generates an executable that will call a file relative to its location. Think of it as batch redirect 2.0.
To use shimgen, supply an output path for the shim executable, relative path to executable, and whether it is a GUI you are calling
Example: shimgen --output=bob --path="the\ relative \path"
Example: shimgen -o="..\bob.exe" -p="the\ relative \path" --gui
  -?, --help, -h             Prints out the options.
  -o, --output=VALUE         REQUIRED: output - The is the name of the shim
                               (e.g. rh.exe for rh.exe). This can also contain
                               the path to the output file
  -p, --path=VALUE           REQUIRED: path - The path to the executable. Can
                               be relative or absolute.
  -i, --iconpath=VALUE       : path of executable for icon - The path to the
                               executable for resolving the icon. Can be
                               relative or absolute (suggest absolute).
  -c, --command=VALUE        command - The command you want to pass to the
                               executable.
      --gui                  GUI - This instructs ShimGen that the underlying
                               executable is a GUI and it should not wait for
                               it to finish execution.
      --debug                debug - This instructs ShimGen to write out all
                               messages. Defaults to false.
